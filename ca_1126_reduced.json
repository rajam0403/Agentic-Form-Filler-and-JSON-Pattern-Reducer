Cornejo Jr.\n\nCity Clerk\n\nPREFACE\n\nThis Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent\nordinances of the City of Azusa, California.\n\nSource materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1971 Code, as\nsupplemented through December 16, 1991, and ordinances subsequently adopted by\nthe city council. The source of each section is included in the history note\nappearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note\nindicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the\nadoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back\nof this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1971 Code, as\nsupplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.\n\nThe chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical\norder, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to\nfacilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and\nwhich refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the\nstate law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is\nincluded at the back of this Code.\n\nChapter and Section Numbering System\n\nThe chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system\nused in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of\ntwo parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the\nchapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the\nsection within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered\n1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each\nsection is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can\nbe inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments.\nFor example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically\ncome between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section\nwould be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the\nsame way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter\nembracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end\nof the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be\nassigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using\none of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the\nalphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new\nchapters.\n\nPage Numbering System\n\nThe page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to\nthe left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion\nof the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of\nthe page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to\nthe left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter.\n\nCODE  |  CD1:1   \n---|---  \nCODE COMPARATIVE TABLES  |  CCT:1   \nSTATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE  |  SLT:1   \nCODE INDEX  |  CDi:1   \n  \n\n\nIndex\n\nThe index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item\nhas been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay\nphraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language\ngenerally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous\ncross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct\nthe user to the particular item in which the user is interested.\n\nLooseleaf Supplements\n\nA special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and\nsupplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication\nwill be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly\nedited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will\nbe distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for\nthe manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.\n\nKeeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the\nholder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become\nthe responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to\nthe attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that\nall such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing\nthem and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for\nhistorical reference purposes.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis publication was under the direct supervision of James S. Vaught,\nSupervising Editor, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code\nCorporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other\nmembers of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able\nassistance throughout the project.\n\nThe publisher is most grateful to Mr. Henry Barbosa, City Attorney, Mr. Adolph\nSolis, City Clerk, and Mr. Roy E. Bruckner, Director of Community Development,\nfor their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this\npublication.
