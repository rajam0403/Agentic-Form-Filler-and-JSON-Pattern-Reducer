    "content": "(a)  In each case enumerated in this Code, the person making the arrest or the person having custody of the person arrested shall without unnecessary delay, but not later than 48 hours after the person is arrested, take the person arrested or have him taken before some magistrate of the county where the accused was arrested or, to provide more expeditiously to the person arrested the warnings described by this article, before a magistrate in any other county of this state.  The arrested person may be taken before the magistrate in person or the image of the arrested person may be presented to the magistrate by means of a videoconference.  The magistrate shall inform in clear language the person arrested, either in person or through a videoconference, of the accusation against him and of any affidavit filed therewith, of his right to retain counsel, of his right to remain silent, of his right to have an attorney present during any interview with peace officers or attorneys representing the state, of his right to terminate the interview at any time, and of his right to have an examining trial.  The magistrate shall also inform the person arrested of the person's right to request the appointment of counsel if the person cannot afford counsel.  The magistrate shall inform the person arrested of the procedures for requesting appointment of counsel.  If applicable, the magistrate shall inform the person that the person may file the affidavit described by Article 17.028(f).  If the person does not speak and understand the English language or is deaf, the magistrate shall inform the person in a manner consistent with Articles 38.30 and 38.31, as appropriate.  The magistrate shall ensure that reasonable assistance in completing the necessary forms for requesting appointment of counsel is provided to the person at the same time.  If the person arrested is indigent and requests appointment of counsel and if the magistrate is authorized under Article 26.04 to appoint counsel for indigent defendants in the county, the magistrate shall appoint counsel in accordance with Article 1.051.  If the magistrate is not authorized to appoint counsel, the magistrate shall without unnecessary delay, but not later than 24 hours after the person arrested requests appointment of counsel, transmit, or cause to be transmitted to the court or to the courts' designee authorized under Article 26.04 to appoint counsel in the county, the forms requesting the appointment of counsel.  The magistrate shall also inform the person arrested that he is not required to make a statement and that any statement made by him may be used against him.  The magistrate shall allow the person arrested reasonable time and opportunity to consult counsel and shall, after determining whether the person is currently on bail for a separate criminal offense and whether the bail decision is subject to Article 17.027, admit the person arrested to bail if allowed by law.  A record of the communication between the arrested person and the magistrate shall be made.  The record shall be preserved until the earlier of the following dates:  (1) the date on which the pretrial hearing ends; or (2) the 91st day after the date on which the record is made if the person is charged with a misdemeanor or the 120th day after the date on which the record is made if the person is charged with a felony.  For purposes of this subsection, \"videoconference\" means a two-way electronic communication of image and sound between the arrested person and the magistrate and includes secure Internet videoconferencing.\n(a-1)  If a magistrate is provided written or electronic notice of credible information that may establish reasonable cause to believe that a person brought before the magistrate has a mental illness or is a person with an intellectual disability, the magistrate shall conduct the proceedings described by Article 16.22 or 17.032, as appropriate.\n(b)  After an accused charged with a misdemeanor punishable by fine only is taken before a magistrate under Subsection (a) and the magistrate has identified the accused with certainty, the magistrate may release the accused without bond and order the accused to appear at a later date for arraignment in the applicable justice court or municipal court.  The order must state in writing the time, date, and place of the arraignment, and the magistrate must sign the order.  The accused shall receive a copy of the order on release.  If an accused fails to appear as required by the order, the judge of the court in which the accused is required to appear shall issue a warrant for the arrest of the accused.  If the accused is arrested and brought before the judge, the judge may admit the accused to bail, and in admitting the accused to bail, the judge should set as the amount of bail an amount double that generally set for the offense for which the accused was arrested.  This subsection does not apply to an accused who has previously been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor other than a misdemeanor punishable by fine only.\n(c) When a deaf accused is taken before a magistrate under this article or Article 14.06 of this Code, an interpreter appointed by the magistrate qualified and sworn as provided in Article 38.31 of this Code shall interpret the warning required by those articles in a language that the accused can understand, including but not limited to sign language.\n(d) If a magistrate determines that a person brought before the magistrate after an arrest authorized by Article 14.051 of this code was arrested unlawfully, the magistrate shall release the person from custody.  If the magistrate determines that the arrest was lawful, the person arrested is considered a fugitive from justice for the purposes of Article 51.13 of this code, and the disposition of the person is controlled by that article.\n(e)  In each case in which a person arrested is taken before a magistrate as required by Subsection (a) or Article 15.18(a), a record shall be made of:\n(1)  the magistrate informing the person of the person's right to request appointment of counsel;\n(2)  the magistrate asking the person whether the person wants to request appointment of counsel; and\n(3)  whether the person requested appointment of counsel.\n(f)  A record required under Subsection (a) or (e) may consist of written forms, electronic recordings, or other documentation as authorized by procedures adopted in the county under Article 26.04(a).  The counsel for the defendant may obtain a copy of the record on payment of a reasonable amount to cover the costs of reproduction or, if the defendant is indigent, the court shall provide a copy to the defendant without charging a cost for the copy.\n(g)  If a person charged with an offense punishable as a misdemeanor appears before a magistrate in compliance with a citation issued under Article 14.06(b) or (c), the magistrate shall perform the duties imposed by this article in the same manner as if the person had been arrested and brought before the magistrate by a peace officer.  After the magistrate performs the duties imposed by this article, the magistrate except for good cause shown may release the person on personal bond.  If a person who was issued a citation under Article 14.06(c) fails to appear as required by that citation, the magistrate before which the person is required to appear shall issue a warrant for the arrest of the accused.\nActs 1965, 59th Leg., vol. 2, p. 317, ch. 722.

If the defendant requests bail before a petition for discretionary review has been filed, the Court of Appeals shall determine the amount of bail.  If the defendant requests bail after a petition for discretionary review has been filed, the Court of Criminal Appeals shall determine the amount of bail.  The sureties on the bail must be approved by the court where the trial was had.  The defendant's right to release under this subsection attaches immediately on the issuance of the Court of Appeals' final ruling as defined by Tex.Cr.App.R. 209(c).\n(i)  Notwithstanding any other law, pending the determination of a defendant's motion for new trial or the defendant's appeal from a misdemeanor conviction, the defendant is entitled to be released after completion of a sentence of confinement imposed for the conviction. The trial court may require the defendant to give a personal bond but may not, either instead of or in addition to the personal bond, require:\n(1)  any condition of the personal bond;\n(2)  another type of bail bond; or\n(3)  a surety or other security.\nActs 1965, 59th Leg., vol. 2, p. 317, ch. 722.

A court that requires reimbursement under this article may require the defendant to reimburse the county only for those days the defendant is confined after the date of conviction or on which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere was entered.  The court may not require a defendant to reimburse the county for those days the defendant was confined after arrest and before the date of conviction or on which the plea of guilty or nolo contendere was entered.\n(d) The court, in determining whether to order reimbursement under this article, shall consider:\n(1) the defendant's employment status, earning ability, and financial resources;  and\n(2) any other special circumstances that may affect the defendant's ability to pay, including child support obligations and including any financial responsibilities owed by the defendant to dependents or restitution payments owed by the defendant to a victim.\n(e) On the day on which a defendant who is required to reimburse the county under this article discharges an executed sentence of confinement or completes the period of confinement required as a condition of community supervision, the sheriff shall present to the defendant a bill computed by multiplying the daily rate of $25 times the number of days the defendant was confined in the county jail, not counting the day on which the execution of the sentence or the period of confinement began.  For purposes of this subsection, a defendant who is confined in county jail for only a portion of a day is nonetheless considered to have been confined for the whole day.\n(f) The court may require a defendant to reimburse the county under this article by paying to the sheriff the bill presented by the sheriff within a specified period or in specified installments.  The end of the period or the last installment may not be later than:\n(1) the end of the period of community supervision, if community supervision is ordered;  or\n(2) the fifth anniversary of the last day of the term of confinement, if the court does not order community supervision.\nAdded by Acts 1999, 76th Leg., ch. 295, Sec. 1, eff.

The state has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that property is subject to forfeiture.\n(c) It is an affirmative defense to forfeiture under this chapter of property belonging to the spouse of a person whose acts gave rise to the seizure of community property that, because of an act of family violence, as defined by Section 71.004, Family Code, the spouse was unable to prevent the act giving rise to the seizure.\n(d) A final conviction for an underlying offense is not a requirement for forfeiture under this chapter.  An owner or interest holder may present evidence of a dismissal or acquittal of an underlying offense in a forfeiture proceeding, and evidence of an acquittal raises a presumption that the property or interest that is the subject of the hearing is nonforfeitable.  This presumption can be rebutted by evidence that the owner or interest holder knew or should have known that the property was contraband.\n(e) It is the intention of the legislature that asset forfeiture is remedial in nature and not a form of punishment.  If the court finds that all or any part of the property is subject to forfeiture, the judge shall forfeit the property to the state, with the attorney representing the state as the agent for the state, except that if the court finds that the nonforfeitable interest of an interest holder in the property is valued in an amount greater than or substantially equal to the present value of the property, the court shall order the property released to the interest holder.  If the court finds that the nonforfeitable interest of an interest holder is valued in an amount substantially less than the present value of the property and that the property is subject to forfeiture, the court shall order the property forfeited to the state with the attorney representing the state acting as the agent of the state, and making necessary orders to protect the nonforfeitable interest of the interest holder.  On final judgment of forfeiture, the attorney representing the state shall dispose of the property in the manner required by Article 59.06 of this code.\n(f) On forfeiture to the state of an amount greater than $2,500, the clerk of the court in which the forfeiture proceeding was held is entitled to court costs in that proceeding as in other civil proceedings unless the forfeiture violates federal requirements for multijurisdictional task force cases authorized under Chapter 362, Local Government Code.  The procedure for collecting the costs is the procedure established under Subsections (a) and (c), Article 59.06.\n(g) If property is seized at a federal checkpoint, the notice of seizure and intended forfeiture may be filed in and the proceeding may be held in:\n(1) the county in which the seizure occurred;  or\n(2) with the consent of the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the property, a county that is adjacent to the county in which the seizure occurred, if both counties are in the same judicial district.\nAdded by Acts 1989, 71st Leg., 1st C.S., ch. 12, Sec. 1, eff.

The court may grant the continuance if the defendant or the defendant's attorney demonstrates good cause for the continuance and that the request is not brought for the purpose of delay or avoidance.  A defendant's failure to attend a deposition or request a continuance in accordance with this subsection constitutes a waiver of the defendant's right to be present at the deposition.\nAdded by Acts 2011, 82nd Leg., R.S., Ch. 104 (S.B. 1680), Sec. 3, eff.

    "content": "(a)  Subject to the restrictions provided by Section 264.408, Family Code, and Article 39.15 of this code, as soon as practicable after receiving a timely request from the defendant the state shall produce and permit the inspection and the electronic duplication, copying, and photographing, by or on behalf of the defendant, of any offense reports, any designated documents, papers, written or recorded statements of the defendant or a witness, including witness statements of law enforcement officers but not including the work product of counsel for the state in the case and their investigators and their notes or report, or any designated books, accounts, letters, photographs, or objects or other tangible things not otherwise privileged that constitute or contain evidence material to any matter involved in the action and that are in the possession, custody, or control of the state or any person under contract with the state.  The state may provide to the defendant electronic duplicates of any documents or other information described by this article.  The rights granted to the defendant under this article do not extend to written communications between the state and an agent, representative, or employee of the state.  This article does not authorize the removal of the documents, items, or information from the possession of the state, and any inspection shall be in the presence of a representative of the state.\n(b)  On a party's request made not later than the 30th day before the date that jury selection in the trial is scheduled to begin or, in a trial without a jury, the presentation of evidence is scheduled to begin, the party receiving the request shall disclose to the requesting party the name and address of each person the disclosing party may use at trial to present evidence under Rules 702, 703, and 705, Texas Rules of Evidence.  Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, the disclosure must be made in writing in hard copy form or by electronic means not later than the 20th day before the date that jury selection in the trial is scheduled to begin or, in a trial without a jury, the presentation of evidence is scheduled to begin.  On motion of a party and on notice to the other parties, the court may order an earlier time at which one or more of the other parties must make the disclosure to the requesting party.\n(c)  If only a portion of the applicable document, item, or information is subject to discovery under this article, the state is not required to produce or permit the inspection of the remaining portion that is not subject to discovery and may withhold or redact that portion.  The state shall inform the defendant that a portion of the document, item, or information has been withheld or redacted.  On request of the defendant, the court shall conduct a hearing to determine whether withholding or redaction is justified under this article or other law.\n(d)  In the case of a pro se defendant, if the court orders the state to produce and permit the inspection of a document, item, or information under this subsection, the state shall permit the pro se defendant to inspect and review the document, item, or information but is not required to allow electronic duplication as described by Subsection (a).\n(e)  Except as provided by Subsection (f), the defendant, the attorney representing the defendant, or an investigator, expert, consulting legal counsel, or other agent of the attorney representing the defendant may not disclose to a third party any documents, evidence, materials, or witness statements received from the state under this article unless:\n(1)  a court orders the disclosure upon a showing of good cause after notice and hearing after considering the security and privacy interests of any victim or witness; or\n(2)  the documents, evidence, materials, or witness statements have already been publicly disclosed.\n(f)  The attorney representing the defendant, or an investigator, expert, consulting legal counsel, or agent for the attorney representing the defendant, may allow a defendant, witness, or prospective witness to view the information provided under this article, but may not allow that person to have copies of the information provided, other than a copy of the witness's own statement.  Before allowing that person to view a document or the witness statement of another under this subsection, the person possessing the information shall redact the address, telephone number, driver's license number, social security number, date of birth, and any bank account or other identifying numbers contained in the document or witness statement.  For purposes of this article, the defendant may not be the agent for the attorney representing the defendant.\n(g)  Nothing in this article shall be interpreted to limit an attorney's ability to communicate regarding his or her case within the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct, except for the communication of information identifying any victim or witness, including name, except as provided in Subsections (e) and (f), address, telephone number, driver's license number, social security number, date of birth, and bank account information or any information that by reference would make it possible to identify a victim or a witness.  Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the disclosure of identifying information to an administrative, law enforcement, regulatory, or licensing agency for the purposes of making a good faith complaint.\n(h)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the state shall disclose to the defendant any exculpatory, impeachment, or mitigating document, item, or information in the possession, custody, or control of the state that tends to negate the guilt of the defendant or would tend to reduce the punishment for the offense charged.\n(h-1)  In this subsection, \"correctional facility\" has the meaning assigned by Section 1.07, Penal Code.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, if the state intends to use at a defendant's trial testimony of a person to whom the defendant made a statement against the defendant's interest while the person was imprisoned or confined in the same correctional facility as the defendant, the state shall disclose to the defendant any information in the possession, custody, or control of the state that is relevant to the person's credibility, including:\n(1)  the person's complete criminal history, including any charges that were dismissed or reduced as part of a plea bargain;\n(2)  any grant, promise, or offer of immunity from prosecution, reduction of sentence, or other leniency or special treatment, given by the state in exchange for the person's testimony; and\n(3)  information concerning other criminal cases in which the person has testified, or offered to testify, against a defendant with whom the person was imprisoned or confined, including any grant, promise, or offer as described by Subdivision (2) given by the state in exchange for the testimony.\n(i)  The state shall electronically record or otherwise document any document, item, or other information provided to the defendant under this article.\n(j)  Before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or before trial, each party shall acknowledge in writing or on the record in open court the disclosure, receipt, and list of all documents, items, and information provided to the defendant under this article.\n(k)  If at any time before, during, or after trial the state discovers any additional document, item, or information required to be disclosed under Subsection (h), the state shall promptly disclose the existence of the document, item, or information to the defendant or the court.\n(l)  A court may order the defendant to pay costs related to discovery under this article, provided that costs may not exceed the charges prescribed by Subchapter F, Chapter 552, Government Code.\n(m)  To the extent of any conflict, this article prevails over Chapter 552, Government Code.\n(n)  This article does not prohibit the parties from agreeing to discovery and documentation requirements equal to or greater than those required under this article.\nActs 1965, 59th Leg., vol. 2, p. 317, ch. 722.\nAmended by Acts 1999, 76th Leg., ch. 578, Sec. 1, eff.

Such rulemaking shall substantially conform to the principles of the \"Model State Administrative Procedures Act,\" 1981 Act, Uniform Laws Annotated, Vol. 15, p.1 (2000), or such other administrative procedures act, as the Interstate Commission deems appropriate consistent with due process requirements under the United States Constitution as now or hereafter interpreted by the United States Supreme Court.  All rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified, as published with the final version of the rule as approved by the Interstate Commission.\nC.  When promulgating a rule, the Interstate Commission shall, at a minimum:\n1.  Publish the proposed rule's entire text stating the reason or reasons for that proposed rule;\n2.  Allow and invite persons to submit written data, facts, opinions, and arguments, which information shall be added to the record and be made publicly available;\n3.

For purposes of this subsection, evidence is substantial if it would be considered substantial evidence under the Model State Administrative Procedures Act.\nE.  If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule, those states may, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, cause that such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.\nF.  The existing rules governing the operation of the Interstate Compact on Juveniles superceded by this Act shall be null and void 12 months after the first meeting of the Interstate Commission created under this compact.\nG.  Upon determination by the Interstate Commission that an emergency exists, the Interstate Commission may promulgate an emergency rule which shall become effective immediately upon adoption, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided hereunder shall be retroactively applied to said rule as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 90 days after the effective date of the emergency rule."

The purpose of this compact is to provide for the mutual development and execution of such programs of cooperation for the confinement, treatment, and rehabilitation of offenders with the most economical use of human and material resources.\nArticle II. Definitions\nAs used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:\n(a) \"State\" means a state of the United States;  the United States of America;  a territory or possession of the United States;  the District of Columbia;  the commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n(b) \"Sending state\" means a state party to this compact in which conviction or court commitment was had.\n(c) \"Receiving state\" means a state party to this compact to which an inmate is sent for confinement other than a state in which conviction or court commitment was had.\n(d) \"Inmate\" means a male or female offender who is committed, under sentence to or confined in a penal or correctional institution.\n(e) \"Institution\" means any penal or correctional facility, including but not limited to a facility for the mentally ill or mentally defective, in which inmates as defined in (d) above may lawfully be confined.\nArticle III. Contracts\n(a) Each party state may make one or more contracts with any one or more of the other party states for the confinement of inmates on behalf of a sending state in institutions situated within receiving states.  Any such contract shall provide for:\n1. Its duration.\n2. Payments to be made to the receiving state by the sending state for inmate maintenance, extraordinary medical and dental expenses, and any participation in or receipt by inmates of rehabilitative or correctional services, facilities, programs, or treatment not reasonably included as part of normal maintenance.\n3.

Procedures and Rights\n(a) Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, such official may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of such other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state.\n(b) The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution.\n(c) Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to this compact shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a prison or other institution within the sending state, for transfer to another institution in which the sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose permitted by the laws of the sending state.  However, the sending state shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article III.\n(d) Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state on the inmates of that sending state who are in institutions pursuant to this compact including a conduct record of each inmate and shall certify such record to the official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have official review of his or her record in determining and altering the disposition of the inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for the sending state.\n(e) All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to this compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner and shall be treated equally with such similar inmates of the receiving state as may be confined in the same institution.  The fact of confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights which the inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of the sending state.\n(f) Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state.

The record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state.  In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph (f), the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state.\n(g) Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate and the sending and receiving states shall agree upon release in some other place.  The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory.\n(h) Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall have any rights and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or his status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state located within such state.\n(i) The parent, guardian, trustee, or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise, or otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or restricted in his exercise of any power in respect of any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact.\nArticle V. Act Not Reviewable in Receiving State:  Extradition\n(a) Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment, or detention for such offense.  The duly accredited officer of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference.\n(b) An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution escaped from is situated.  In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.\nArticle VI. Federal Aid\nAny state party to this compact may accept federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant thereto.  Any inmate in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provision.  However, if such program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen, the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor.\nArticle VII. Entry Into Force\nThis compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states.  Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of such states upon similar action by such state.\nArticle VIII. Withdrawal and Termination\nThis compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the compact and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states.  An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notices provided in the statute have been sent.  Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal.  Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawal state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact.\nArticle IX. Other Arrangements Unaffected\nNothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair an agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a nonparty state for the confinement, rehabilitation, or treatment of inmates, nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements.\nArticle X. Construction and Severability\n(a) The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable.  If any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.  If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.\n(b) Powers.  The director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice is authorized and directed to do all things necessary or incidental to the carrying out of the compact in every particular.\nAdded by Acts 1985, 69th Leg., ch. 24, Sec. 1, eff.

The term does not include a system that contains or operates global positioning system technology, radio frequency identification technology, or any other similar technology that is implanted in or otherwise invades or violates the individual's body.\n(b)  A magistrate may require as a condition of release on bond that a defendant charged with an offense involving family violence:\n(1)  refrain from going to or near a residence, school, place of employment, or other location, as specifically described in the bond, frequented by an alleged victim of the offense;\n(2)  carry or wear a global positioning monitoring system device and, except as provided by Subsection (h), pay a reimbursement fee for the costs associated with operating that system in relation to the defendant;\n(3)  except as provided by Subsection (h), if the alleged victim of the offense consents after receiving the information described by Subsection (d), pay a reimbursement fee for the costs associated with providing the victim with an electronic receptor device that:\n(A)  is capable of receiving the global positioning monitoring system information from the device carried or worn by the defendant; and\n(B)  notifies the victim if the defendant is at or near a location that the defendant has been ordered to refrain from going to or near under Subdivision (1); or\n(4)  refrain from tracking or monitoring personal property or a motor vehicle in the possession of the alleged victim of the offense, without the victim's effective consent, including by:\n(A)  using a tracking application on a personal electronic device in the possession of the victim or using a tracking device; or\n(B)  physically following the victim or causing another to physically follow the victim.\n(c)  Before imposing a condition described by Subsection (b)(1), a magistrate must afford an alleged victim an opportunity to provide the magistrate with a list of areas from which the victim would like the defendant excluded and shall consider the victim's request, if any, in determining the locations the defendant will be ordered to refrain from going to or near.  If the magistrate imposes a condition described by Subsection (b)(1), the magistrate shall specifically describe the locations that the defendant has been ordered to refrain from going to or near and the minimum distances, if any, that the defendant must maintain from those locations.\n(d)  Before imposing a condition described by Subsection (b)(3), a magistrate must provide to an alleged victim information regarding:\n(1)  the victim's right to participate in a global positioning monitoring system or to refuse to participate in that system and the procedure for requesting that the magistrate terminate the victim's participation;\n(2)  the manner in which the global positioning monitoring system technology functions and the risks and limitations of that technology, and the extent to which the system will track and record the victim's location and movements;\n(3)  any locations that the defendant is ordered to refrain from going to or near and the minimum distances, if any, that the defendant must maintain from those locations;\n(4)  any sanctions that the court may impose on the defendant for violating a condition of bond imposed under this article;\n(5)  the procedure that the victim is to follow, and support services available to assist the victim, if the defendant violates a condition of bond or if the global positioning monitoring system equipment fails;\n(6)  community services available to assist the victim in obtaining shelter, counseling, education, child care, legal representation, and other assistance available to address the consequences of family violence;  and\n(7)  the fact that the victim's communications with the court concerning the global positioning monitoring system and any restrictions to be imposed on the defendant's movements are not confidential.\n(e)  In addition to the information described by Subsection (d), a magistrate shall provide to an alleged victim who participates in a global positioning monitoring system under this article the name and telephone number of an appropriate person employed by a local law enforcement agency whom the victim may call to request immediate assistance if the defendant violates a condition of bond imposed under this article.\n(f)  In determining whether to order a defendant's participation in a global positioning monitoring system under this article, the magistrate shall consider the likelihood that the defendant's participation will deter the defendant from seeking to kill, physically injure, stalk, or otherwise threaten the alleged victim before trial.\n(g)  An alleged victim may request that the magistrate terminate the victim's participation in a global positioning monitoring system at any time.  The magistrate may not impose sanctions on the victim for requesting termination of the victim's participation in or refusing to participate in a global positioning monitoring system under this article.\n(h)  If the magistrate determines that a defendant is indigent, the magistrate may, based on a sliding scale established by local rule, require the defendant to pay a reimbursement fee under Subsection (b)(2) or (3) in an amount that is less than the full amount of the costs associated with operating the global positioning monitoring system in relation to the defendant or providing the victim with an electronic receptor device.\n(i)  If an indigent defendant pays to an entity that operates a global positioning monitoring system the partial amount ordered by a magistrate under Subsection (h), the entity shall accept the partial amount as payment in full.

    "content": "(a)  Prior to accepting a plea of guilty or a plea of nolo contendere, the court shall admonish the defendant of:\n(1)  the range of the punishment attached to the offense;\n(2)  the fact that the recommendation of the prosecuting attorney as to punishment is not binding on the court. Provided that the court shall inquire as to the existence of a plea bargain agreement between the state and the defendant and, if an agreement exists, the court shall inform the defendant whether it will follow or reject the agreement in open court and before any finding on the plea. Should the court reject the agreement, the defendant shall be permitted to withdraw the defendant's plea of guilty or nolo contendere;\n(3)  the fact that if the punishment assessed does not exceed the punishment recommended by the prosecutor and agreed to by the defendant and the defendant's attorney, the trial court must give its permission to the defendant before the defendant may prosecute an appeal on any matter in the case except for those matters raised by written motions filed prior to trial;\n(4)  the fact that if the defendant is not a citizen of the United States of America, a plea of guilty or nolo contendere for the offense charged may result in deportation, the exclusion from admission to this country, or the denial of naturalization under federal law;\n(5)  the fact that the defendant will be required to meet the registration requirements of Chapter 62, if the defendant is convicted of or placed on deferred adjudication for an offense for which a person is subject to registration under that chapter; and\n(6)  the fact that if the defendant is placed on community supervision, after satisfactorily fulfilling the conditions of community supervision and on expiration of the period of community supervision, the court is authorized to release the defendant from the penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense as provided by Article 42A.701(f).\n(b) No plea of guilty or plea of nolo contendere shall be accepted by the court unless it appears that the defendant is mentally competent and the plea is free and voluntary.\n(c) In admonishing the defendant as herein provided, substantial compliance by the court is sufficient, unless the defendant affirmatively shows that he was not aware of the consequences of his plea and that he was misled or harmed by the admonishment of the court.\n(d)  Except as provided by Subsection (d-1), the court may make the admonitions required by this article either orally or in writing. If the court makes the admonitions in writing, it must receive a statement signed by the defendant and the defendant's attorney that the defendant understands the admonitions and is aware of the consequences of the plea.

The failure of the court to comply with Subsection (a)(5) is not a ground for the defendant to set aside the conviction, sentence, or plea.\n(h-1)  The court must substantially comply with Subsection (a)(6).  The failure of the court to comply with Subsection (a)(6) is not a ground for the defendant to set aside the conviction, sentence, or plea.\n(i) Notwithstanding this article, a court shall not order the state or any of its prosecuting attorneys to participate in mediation, dispute resolution, arbitration, or other similar procedures in relation to a criminal prosecution unless upon written consent of the state.\nActs 1965, 59th Leg., p. 317, ch. 722, Sec. 1, eff.

    "content": "PURPOSE\nThe compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents, and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped, or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others.  The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence.  The compacting states also recognize that congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. Section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.\nIt is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to:  (A) ensure that the juveniles who are moved under this compact to another state for probation or parole supervision and services are governed in the receiving state by the same standards that apply to juveniles receiving such supervision and services in the receiving state; (B) ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected and balanced with the juvenile's and the juvenile's family's best interests and welfare when an interstate movement is under consideration; (C) return juveniles who have run away, absconded, or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return through a fair and prompt judicial review process that ensures that the requisition is in order and that the transport is properly supervised; (D) make provisions for contracts between member states for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services; (E) provide for the effective tracking of juveniles who move interstate under the compact's provisions; (F) equitably allocate the costs, benefits, and obligations of the compacting states; (G) establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders, ensuring that a receiving state accepts supervision of a juvenile when the juvenile's parent or other person having legal custody resides or is undertaking residence there; (H) ensure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; (I) establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles who move interstate under this compact that prevents public disclosure of identity and individual treatment information but allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators; (J) monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; (K) coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and (L) coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise.  It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business.  Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact.  The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact."

Water released from Texas' reservoirs to establish the minimum flow of 36 cubic feet per second, shall be classed as free water at the Stateline and divided equally between the two States.\n(c)  The right of each State to construct impoundment reservoirs and other works of improvement on the Sabine River or its tributaries located wholly within its boundaries is hereby recognized.\n(d)  In the event that either State constructs reservoir storage on the tributaries below Stateline after January 1, 1953, there shall be deducted from that State's share of the flow in the Sabine River all reductions in flow resulting from the operation of the tributary storage and conversely such State shall be entitled to the increased flow resulting from the regulation provided by such storage.\n(e)  Each State shall have the right to use the main channel of the Sabine River to convey water stored on the Sabine River or its tributaries located wholly within its boundaries, downstream to a desired point of removal without loss of ownership of such stored waters.  In the event that such water is released by a State through the natural channel of a tributary and the channel of the Sabine River to a downstream point of removal, a reduction shall be made in the amount of water which can be withdrawn at the point of removal equal to the transmission losses.\n(f)  Each State shall have the right to withdraw its share of the water from the channel of the Sabine River in the Stateline reach in accordance with Article VII.  Neither State shall withdraw at any point more than its share of the flow at that point except, that pursuant to findings and determination of the Administration as provided under Article VII of this Compact, either State may withdraw more or less of its share of the water at any point providing that its aggregate withdrawal shall not exceed its total share.  Withdrawals made pursuant to this paragraph shall not prejudice or impair the existing rights of users of Sabine River waters.\n(g)  Waters stored in reservoirs constructed by the States in the Stateline reach shall be shared by each State in proportion to its contribution to the cost of storage.  Neither State shall have the right to construct a dam on the Stateline reach without the consent of the other State.\n(h)  Each State may vary the rate and manner of withdrawal of its share of such jointly stored waters on the Stateline reach, subject to meeting the obligations for amortization of the cost of the joint storage.  In any event, neither State shall withdraw more than its prorata share in any one year (a year meaning a water year, October 1st to September 30th) except by authority of the Administration.  All jointly stored water remaining at the end of a water year shall be reapportioned between the States in the same proportion as their contribution to the cost of the storage.\n(i)  Except for jointly stored water, as provided in (h) above, each State must use its apportionment of the natural stream flows as they occur and there shall be no allowance of accumulation of credits or debits for or against either State.  The failure of either State to use the stream flow or any part thereof, the use of which is apportioned to it under the terms of this Compact, shall not constitute a relinquishment of the right to such use in the future;  conversely, the failure of either State to use the water at the time it is available does not give it the right to the flow in excess of its share of the flow at any other time.\n(j)  From the apportionment of waters of the Sabine River as defined in this Article, there shall be excluded from such apportionment all waters consumed in either State for domestic and stock water uses.  Domestic and stock water reservoirs shall be so excluded.\n(k)  Each State may use its share of the water apportioned to it in any manner that may be deemed beneficial by that State."

    "content": "(a)  When a defendant is convicted of a misdemeanor and the defendant's punishment is assessed at a pecuniary fine or is confined in a jail after conviction of a felony for which a fine is imposed, if the defendant is unable to pay the fine and costs adjudged against the defendant, the defendant may for such time as will satisfy the judgment be put to work in the county jail industries program, in the workhouse, or on the county farm, or public improvements and maintenance projects of the county or a political subdivision located in whole or in part in the county, as provided in Article 43.10; or if there is no such county jail industries program, workhouse, farm, or improvements and maintenance projects, the defendant shall be confined in jail for a sufficient length of time to discharge the full amount of fine and costs adjudged against the defendant; rating such confinement at $100 for each day and rating such labor at $100 for each day; provided, however, that the defendant may pay the pecuniary fine assessed against the defendant at any time while the defendant is serving at work in the county jail industries program, in the workhouse, or on the county farm, or on the public improvements and maintenance projects of the county or a political subdivision located in whole or in part in the county, or while the defendant is serving the defendant's jail sentence, and in such instances the defendant is entitled to the credit earned under this subsection during the time that the defendant has served and the defendant shall only be required to pay the balance of the pecuniary fine assessed against the defendant.  A defendant who performs labor under this article during a day in which the defendant is confined is entitled to both the credit for confinement and the credit for labor provided by this article.\n(b) In its discretion, the court may order that for each day's confinement served by a defendant under this article, the defendant receive credit toward payment of the pecuniary fine and credit toward payment of costs adjudged against the defendant.  Additionally, the court may order that the defendant receive credit under this article for each day's confinement served by the defendant as punishment for the offense.\n(c) In its discretion, the court may order that a defendant serving concurrent, but not consecutive, sentences for two or more misdemeanors may, for each day served, receive credit toward the satisfaction of costs and fines imposed for each separate offense.\n(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, in its discretion, the court or the sheriff of the county may grant an additional two days credit for each day served to any inmate participating in an approved work program under this article or a rehabilitation, restitution, or education program.\n(e)  A court in a county that operates an electronic monitoring program or contracts with a private vendor to operate an electronic monitoring program under Section 351.904, Local Government Code, or that is served by a community supervision and corrections department that operates an electronic monitoring program approved by the community justice assistance division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, may require a defendant who is unable to pay a fine or costs to discharge all or part of the fine or costs by participating in the program.  A defendant who participates in an electronic monitoring program under this subsection discharges fines and costs in the same manner as if the defendant were confined in county jail.\n(f) A court may require a defendant who is unable to pay a fine or costs to discharge all or part of the fine or costs by performing community service.\n(g)  In the court's order requiring a defendant to perform community service under Subsection (f), the court must specify:\n(1)  the number of hours of community service the defendant is required to perform;\n(2)  whether the community supervision and corrections department or a court-related services office will perform the administrative duties required by the placement of the defendant in the community service program; and\n(3)  the date by which the defendant must submit to the court documentation verifying the defendant's completion of the community service.\n(h)  The court may order the defendant to perform community service under Subsection (f):\n(1)  by attending:\n(A)  a work and job skills training program;\n(B)  a preparatory class for the high school equivalency examination administered under Section 7.111, Education Code;\n(C)  an alcohol or drug abuse program;\n(D)  a rehabilitation program;\n(E)  a counseling program, including a self-improvement program;\n(F)  a mentoring program; or\n(G)  any similar activity; or\n(2)  for:\n(A)  a governmental entity;\n(B)  a nonprofit organization or another organization that provides services to the general public that enhance social welfare and the general well-being of the community, as determined by the court; or\n(C)  an educational institution.\n(h-1)  An entity that accepts a defendant under Subsection (f) to perform community service must agree to supervise, either on-site or remotely, the defendant in the performance of the defendant's community service and report on the defendant's community service to the district probation department or court-related services office.\n(i) The court may require bail of a defendant to ensure the defendant's faithful performance of community service under Subsection (f) of this article and may attach conditions to the bail as it determines are proper.\n(j)  A court may not order a defendant to perform more than 16 hours per week of community service under Subsection (f) unless the court determines that requiring the defendant to perform additional hours does not impose an undue hardship on the defendant or the defendant's dependents.\n(k) A defendant is considered to have discharged $100 of fines or costs for each eight hours of community service performed under Subsection (f) of this article.\n(l)  A sheriff, employee of a sheriff's department, county commissioner, county employee, county judge, an employee of a community corrections and supervision department, restitution center, or officer or employee of a political subdivision other than a county or an entity that accepts a defendant under this article to perform community service is not liable for damages arising from an act or failure to act in connection with manual labor performed by an inmate or community service performed by a defendant under this article if the act or failure to act:\n(1)  was performed pursuant to confinement or other court order; and\n(2)  was not intentional, wilfully or wantonly negligent, or performed with conscious indifference or reckless disregard for the safety of others.\n(m)  Repealed by Acts 2007, 80th Leg., R.S., Ch. 1263, Sec. 22, eff.

    "content": "RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMISSION\nAND OPTING OUT OF UNIFORM STANDARDS\n1.  Rulemaking Authority.  The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules, including Uniform Standards, and Operating Procedures in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this Compact.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this Act, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the Commission shall be invalid and have no force and effect.\n2.  Rulemaking Procedure.  Rules and Operating Procedures shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that conforms to the Model State Administrative Procedure Act of 1981 as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the Commission.  Before the Commission adopts a Uniform Standard, the Commission shall give written notice to the relevant state legislative committee(s) in each Compacting State responsible for insurance issues of its intention to adopt the Uniform Standard.  The Commission in adopting a Uniform Standard shall consider fully all submitted materials and issue a concise explanation of its decision.\n3.  Effective Date and Opt Out of a Uniform Standard.  A Uniform Standard shall become effective ninety (90) days after its promulgation by the Commission or such later date as the Commission may determine; provided, however, that a Compacting State may opt out of a Uniform Standard as provided in this Article.  \"Opt out\" shall be defined as any action by a Compacting State to decline to adopt or participate in a promulgated Uniform Standard.  All other Rules and Operating Procedures, and amendments thereto, shall become effective as of the date specified in each Rule, Operating Procedure or amendment.\n4.  Opt Out Procedure.  A Compacting State may opt out of a Uniform Standard, either by legislation or regulation duly promulgated by the Insurance Department under the Compacting State's Administrative Procedure Act.  If a Compacting State elects to opt out of a Uniform Standard by regulation, it must (a) give written notice to the Commission no later than ten (10) business days after the Uniform Standard is promulgated, or at the time the State becomes a Compacting State and (b) find that the Uniform Standard does not provide reasonable protections to the citizens of the State, given the conditions in the State.  The Commissioner shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, based on a preponderance of the evidence, detailing the conditions in the State which warrant a departure from the Uniform Standard and determining that the Uniform Standard would not reasonably protect the citizens of the State.  The Commissioner must consider and balance the following factors and find that the conditions in the State and needs of the citizens of the State outweigh:  (i) the intent of the legislature to participate in, and the benefits of, an interstate agreement to establish national uniform consumer protections for the Products subject to this Act; and (ii) the presumption that a Uniform Standard adopted by the Commission provides reasonable protections to consumers of the relevant Product.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, a Compacting State may, at the time of its enactment of this Compact, prospectively opt out of all Uniform Standards involving long-term care insurance products by expressly providing for such opt out in the enacted Compact, and such an opt out shall not be treated as a material variance in the offer or acceptance of any State to participate in this Compact.  Such an opt out shall be effective at the time of enactment of this Compact by the Compacting State and shall apply to all existing Uniform Standards involving long-term care insurance products and those subsequently promulgated.\n5.  Effect of Opt Out.  If a Compacting State elects to opt out of a Uniform Standard, the Uniform Standard shall remain applicable in the Compacting State electing to opt out until such time the opt out legislation is enacted into law or the regulation opting out becomes effective.\nOnce the opt out of a Uniform Standard by a Compacting State becomes effective as provided under the laws of that State, the Uniform Standard shall have no further force and effect in that State unless and until the legislation or regulation implementing the opt out is repealed or otherwise becomes ineffective under the laws of the State.  If a Compacting State opts out of a Uniform Standard after the Uniform Standard has been made effective in that State, the opt out shall have the same prospective effect as provided under Article XIV for withdrawals.\n6.  Stay of Uniform Standard.  If a Compacting State has formally initiated the process of opting out of a Uniform Standard by regulation, and while the regulatory opt out is pending, the Compacting State may petition the Commission, at least fifteen (15) days before the effective date of the Uniform Standard, to stay the effectiveness of the Uniform Standard in that State. The Commission may grant a stay if it determines the regulatory opt out is being pursued in a reasonable manner and there is a likelihood of success.  If a stay is granted or extended by the Commission, the stay or extension thereof may postpone the effective date by up to ninety (90) days, unless affirmatively extended by the Commission; provided, a stay may not be permitted to remain in effect for more than one (1) year unless the Compacting State can show extraordinary circumstances which warrant a continuance of the stay, including, but not limited to, the existence of a legal challenge which prevents the Compacting State from opting out. A stay may be terminated by the Commission upon notice that the rulemaking process has been terminated.\n7.  Not later than thirty (30) days after a Rule or Operating Procedure is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the Rule or Operating Procedure; provided, that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the Rule or Operating Procedure from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success.  The court shall give deference to the actions of the Commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the Rule or Operating Procedure to be unlawful if the Rule or Operating Procedure represents a reasonable exercise of the Commission's authority."

    "title": "2023 Texas Statutes Code of Criminal Procedure Title 1 - Code of Criminal Procedure Chapter 38 - Evidence in Criminal Actions Article 38.43. Evidence Containing Biological Material",
    "content": "(a)  In this article, \"biological evidence\" means:\n(1)  the contents of a sexual assault examination kit; or\n(2)  any item that contains blood, semen, hair, saliva, skin tissue, fingernail scrapings, bone, bodily fluids, or any other identifiable biological material that was collected as part of an investigation of an alleged felony offense or conduct constituting a felony offense that might reasonably be used to:\n(A)  establish the identity of the person committing the offense or engaging in the conduct constituting the offense; or\n(B)  exclude a person from the group of persons who could have committed the offense or engaged in the conduct constituting the offense.\n(b)  This article applies to a governmental or public entity or an individual, including a law enforcement agency, prosecutor's office, court, public hospital, or crime laboratory, that is charged with the collection, storage, preservation, analysis, or retrieval of biological evidence.\n(c)  An entity or individual described by Subsection (b) shall ensure that biological evidence, other than the contents of a sexual assault examination kit subject to Subsection (c-1), collected pursuant to an investigation or prosecution of a felony offense or conduct constituting a felony offense is retained and preserved:\n(1)  for not less than 40 years, or until any applicable statute of limitations has expired, if there is an unapprehended actor associated with the offense; or\n(2)  in a case in which a defendant has been convicted, placed on deferred adjudication community supervision, or adjudicated as having engaged in delinquent conduct and there are no additional unapprehended actors associated with the offense:\n(A)  until the inmate is executed, dies, or is released on parole, if the defendant is convicted of a capital felony;\n(B)  until the defendant dies, completes the defendant's sentence, or is released on parole or mandatory supervision, if the defendant is sentenced to a term of confinement or imprisonment in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice;\n(C)  until the defendant completes the defendant's term of community supervision, including deferred adjudication community supervision, if the defendant is placed on community supervision;\n(D)  until the defendant dies, completes the defendant's sentence, or is released on parole, mandatory supervision, or juvenile probation, if the defendant is committed to the Texas Juvenile Justice Department; or\n(E)  until the defendant completes the defendant's term of juvenile probation, including a term of community supervision upon transfer of supervision to a criminal court, if the defendant is placed on juvenile probation.\n(c-1)  An entity or individual described by Subsection (b) shall ensure that the contents of a sexual assault examination kit collected pursuant to an investigation or prosecution of a felony offense or conduct constituting a felony offense is retained and preserved for not less than 40 years, or until any applicable statute of limitations has expired, whichever period is longer.  This subsection applies regardless of whether a person has been apprehended for or charged with committing the offense.\n(d)  The attorney representing the state, clerk, or other officer in possession of biological evidence described by Subsection (a) may destroy the evidence, but only if the attorney, clerk, or officer by mail notifies the defendant, the last attorney of record for the defendant, and the convicting court of the decision to destroy the evidence and a written objection is not received by the attorney, clerk, or officer from the defendant, attorney of record, or court before the 91st day after the later of the following dates:\n(1)  the date on which the attorney representing the state, clerk, or other officer receives proof that the defendant received notice of the planned destruction of evidence; or\n(2)  the date on which notice of the planned destruction of evidence is mailed to the last attorney of record for the defendant.\nText of subsection effective until January 01, 2025\n(e)  To the extent of any conflict, this article controls over Article 2.21.\nText of subsection effective on January 01, 2025\n(e)  To the extent of any conflict, this article controls over Article 2A.155.\n(f)  The Department of Public Safety shall adopt standards and rules authorizing a county with a population less than 100,000 to ensure the preservation of biological evidence by promptly delivering the evidence to the Department of Public Safety for storage in accordance with Section 411.053, Government Code, and department rules.\n(g)  The Department of Public Safety shall adopt standards and rules, consistent with best practices, relating to a person described by Subsection (b), that specify the manner of collection, storage, preservation, and retrieval of biological evidence.\n(h)  A person described by Subsection (b) may solicit and accept gifts, grants, donations, and contributions to support the collection, storage, preservation, retrieval, and destruction of biological evidence.\n(i)  Before a defendant is tried for a capital offense in which the state is seeking the death penalty, subject to Subsection (j), the state shall require either the Department of Public Safety through one of its laboratories or a laboratory accredited under Article 38.01 to perform DNA testing, in accordance with the laboratory's capabilities at the time the testing is performed, on any biological evidence that was collected as part of an investigation of the offense and is in the possession of the state.  The laboratory that performs the DNA testing shall pay for all DNA testing performed in accordance with this subsection.\n(j)  As soon as practicable after the defendant is charged with a capital offense, or on a motion by the state or the defendant in a capital case, unless the state has affirmatively waived the death penalty in writing, the court shall order the state and the defendant to meet and confer about which biological materials collected as part of an investigation of the offense qualify as biological evidence that is required to be tested under Subsection (i).  If the state and the defendant agree on which biological materials constitute biological evidence, the biological evidence shall be tested in accordance with Subsection (i).  If the state and the defendant do not agree on which biological materials qualify as biological evidence, the state or the defendant may request the court to hold a hearing to determine the issue.  On receipt of a request for a hearing under this subsection, the court shall set a date for the hearing and provide written notice of the hearing date to the state and the defendant.  At the hearing, there is a rebuttable presumption that the biological material that the defendant requests to be tested constitutes biological evidence that is required to be tested under Subsection (i).  This subsection does not in any way prohibit the state from testing biological evidence in the state's possession.\n(k)  If an item of biological evidence is destroyed or lost as a result of DNA testing performed under Subsection (i), the laboratory that tested the evidence must provide to the defendant any bench notes prepared by the laboratory that are related to the testing of the evidence and the results of that testing.\n(l)  The defendant's exclusive remedy for testing that was not performed as required under Subsection (i) or (j) is to seek a writ of mandamus from the court of criminal appeals at any time on or before the date an application for a writ of habeas corpus is due to be filed in the defendant's case under Section 4(a), Article 11.071.  An application for a writ of mandamus under this subsection does not toll any period of limitations applicable to a habeas petition under state or federal law.  The defendant is entitled to only one application for a writ of mandamus under this subsection.  At any time after the date an application for a writ of habeas corpus is filed in the defendant's case under Section 4(a), Article 11.071, the defendant may file one additional motion for forensic testing under Chapter 64.\n(m)  A defendant may have another laboratory accredited under Article 38.01 perform additional testing of any biological evidence required to be tested under Subsection (i).  On an ex parte showing of good cause to the court, a defendant may have a laboratory accredited under Article 38.01 perform testing of any biological material that is not required to be tested under Subsection (i).  The defendant is responsible for the cost of any testing performed under this subsection.\nAdded by Acts 2001, 77th Leg., ch. 2, Sec. 1, eff.

    "content": "(a)  In addition to any fine authorized by law, the court that sentences a defendant convicted of an offense may order the defendant to make restitution to any victim of the offense or to the compensation to victims of crime fund established under Subchapter J, Chapter 56B, to the extent that fund has paid compensation to or on behalf of the victim.  If the court does not order restitution or orders partial restitution under this subsection, the court shall state on the record the reasons for not making the order or for the limited order.\n(b)(1)  If the offense results in damage to or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the offense, the court may order the defendant:\n(A)  to return the property to the owner of the property or someone designated by the owner; or\n(B)  if return of the property is impossible or impractical or is an inadequate remedy, to pay an amount equal to the greater of:\n(i)  the value of the property on the date of the damage, loss, or destruction; or\n(ii)  the value of the property on the date of sentencing, less the value of any part of the property that is returned on the date the property is returned.\n(2)  If the offense results in personal injury to a victim, the court may order the defendant to make restitution to:\n(A)  the victim for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the offense; or\n(B)  the compensation to victims of crime fund to the extent that fund has paid compensation to or on behalf of the victim.\n(3)  If the victim or the victim's estate consents, the court may, in addition to an order under Subdivision (2), order the defendant to make restitution by performing services instead of by paying money or make restitution to a person or organization, other than the compensation to victims of crime fund, designated by the victim or the estate.\n(c)  The court, in determining whether to order restitution and the amount of restitution, shall consider:\n(1)  the amount of the loss sustained by any victim and the amount paid to or on behalf of the victim by the compensation to victims of crime fund as a result of the offense; and\n(2)   other factors the court deems appropriate.\n(d)  If the court orders restitution under this article and the victim is deceased the court shall order the defendant to make restitution to the victim's estate.\n(e)  The court shall impose an order of restitution that is as fair as possible to the victim or to the compensation to victims of crime fund, as applicable.  The imposition of the order may not unduly complicate or prolong the sentencing process.\n(f)(1)  The court may not order restitution for a loss for which the victim has received or will receive compensation only from a source other than the compensation to victims of crime fund.  The court may, in the interest of justice, order restitution to any person who has compensated the victim for the loss to the extent the person paid compensation.  An order of restitution shall require that all restitution to a victim or to the compensation to victims of crime fund be made before any restitution to any other person is made under the order.\n(2)  Any amount recovered by a victim from a person ordered to pay restitution in a federal or state civil proceeding is reduced by any amount previously paid to the victim by the person under an order of restitution.\n(g)  The court may require a defendant to make restitution under this article within a specified period or in specified installments.   The end of the period or the last installment may not be later than:\n(1)  the end of the period of probation, if probation is ordered;\n(2)  five years after the end of the term of imprisonment imposed, if the court does not order probation; or\n(3)  five years after the date of sentencing in any other case.\n(g-1)  If the court does not provide otherwise, the defendant shall make restitution immediately.\n(g-2)  Except as provided by Subsection (n), the order of restitution must require the defendant to:\n(1)  make restitution directly to the person or agency that will accept and forward restitution payments to the victim or other person eligible for restitution under this article, including the compensation to victims of crime fund;\n(2)  make restitution directly to the victim or other person eligible for restitution under this article, including the compensation to victims of crime fund; or\n(3)  deliver the amount or property due as restitution to a community supervision and corrections department for transfer to the victim or person.\n(h)  If a defendant is placed on community supervision or is paroled or released on mandatory supervision, the court or the parole panel shall order the payment of restitution ordered under this article as a condition of community supervision, parole, or mandatory supervision.  The court may revoke community supervision and the parole panel may revoke parole or mandatory supervision if the defendant fails to comply with the order.  In determining whether to revoke community supervision, parole, or mandatory supervision, the court or parole panel shall consider:\n(1)  the defendant's employment status;\n(2)  the defendant's current and future earning ability;\n(3)  the defendant's current and future financial resources;\n(4)  the willfulness of the defendant's failure to pay;\n(5)  any other special circumstances that may affect the defendant's ability to pay; and\n(6)  the victim's financial resources or ability to pay expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the offense.\n(i)  In addition to any other terms and conditions of community supervision imposed under Chapter 42A, the court may require a defendant to reimburse the compensation to victims of crime fund created under Subchapter J, Chapter 56B, for any amounts paid from that fund to or on behalf of a victim of the defendant's offense.  In this subsection, \"victim\" has the meaning assigned by Article 56B.003.\n(j)  The court may order a community supervision and corrections department to obtain information pertaining to the factors listed in Subsection (c).  The supervision officer shall include the information in the report required under Article 42A.252(a) or a separate report, as the court directs.  The court shall permit the defendant and the prosecuting attorney to read the report.\n(k)  The court shall resolve any dispute relating to the proper amount or type of restitution.  The standard of proof is a preponderance of the evidence.  The burden of demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained by a victim as a result of the offense is on the prosecuting attorney.  The burden of demonstrating the financial resources of the defendant and the financial needs of the defendant and the defendant's dependents is on the defendant.  The burden of demonstrating other matters as the court deems appropriate is on the party designated by the court as justice requires.\n(l)  Conviction of a defendant for an offense involving the act giving rise to restitution under this article estops the defendant from denying the essential allegations of that offense in any subsequent federal civil proceeding or state civil proceeding brought by the victim, to the extent consistent with state law.\n(m)  An order of restitution may be enforced by the state or a victim named in the order to receive the restitution in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action.\n(n)  If a defendant is convicted of or receives deferred adjudication for an offense under Section 25.05, Penal Code, if the child support order on which prosecution of the offense was based required the defendant to pay the support to a local registry or the Title IV-D agency, and if the court orders restitution under this article, the order of restitution must require the defendant to pay the child support in the following manner:\n(1)  during any period in which the defendant is under the supervision of a community supervision and corrections department, to the department for transfer to the local registry or Title IV-D agency designated as the place of payment in the child support order; and\n(2)  during any period in which the defendant is not under the supervision of a department, directly to the registry or agency described by Subdivision (1).\n(o)  The department may waive a supervision fee or an administrative fee imposed on an inmate under Section 508.182, Government Code, during any period in which the inmate is required to pay restitution under this article.\n(p)(1)  A court shall order a defendant convicted of an offense under Section 28.03(f), Penal Code, involving damage or destruction inflicted on a place of human burial or under Section 42.08, Penal Code, to make restitution in the amount described by Subsection (b)(1)(B) to a cemetery organization operating a cemetery affected by the commission of the offense.\n(2)  If a court orders an unemancipated minor to make restitution under Subsection (a) and the minor is financially unable to make the restitution, the court may order:\n(A)  the minor to perform a specific number of hours of community service to satisfy the restitution; or\n(B)  the parents or other person responsible for the minor's support to make the restitution in the amount described by Subsection (b)(1)(B).\n(3)  In this subsection, \"cemetery\" and \"cemetery organization\" have the meanings assigned by Section 711.001, Health and Safety Code.\n(q)  The court shall order a defendant convicted of an offense under Section 22.11, Penal Code, to make restitution to the victim of the offense or the victim's employer in an amount equal to the sum of any expenses incurred by the victim or employer to:\n(1)  test the victim for HIV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, tuberculosis, or any other disease designated as a reportable disease under Section 81.048, Health and Safety Code; or\n(2)  treat the victim for HIV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, tuberculosis, or any other disease designated as a reportable disease under Section 81.048, Health and Safety Code, the victim contracts as a result of the offense.\n(r)  The court may order a defendant convicted of an offense under Section 43.26, Penal Code, to make restitution to an individual who as a child younger than 18 years of age was depicted in the visual material, in an amount equal to the expenses incurred by the individual as a result of the offense, including:\n(1)  medical services relating to physical, psychiatric, or psychological care;\n(2)  physical and occupational therapy or rehabilitation;\n(3)  necessary transportation, temporary housing, and child care expenses;\n(4)  lost income; and\n(5)  attorney's fees.\n(s)(1)  A court shall order a defendant convicted of an offense under Section 28.08, Penal Code, to make restitution by:\n(A)  reimbursing the owner of the property for the cost of restoring the property; or\n(B)  with the consent of the owner of the property, personally restoring the property by removing or painting over any markings the defendant made.\n(2)  A court shall order a defendant convicted of an offense under Section 28.08, Penal Code, to make restitution to a political subdivision that owns public property or erects a street sign or official traffic-control device on which the defendant makes markings in violation of Section 28.08, Penal Code, by:\n(A)  paying an amount equal to the lesser of the cost to the political subdivision of replacing or restoring the public property, street sign, or official traffic-control device; or\n(B)  with the consent of the political subdivision, restoring the public property, street sign, or official traffic-control device by removing or painting over any markings made by the defendant on the property, sign, or device.\n(3)  If the court orders a defendant to make restitution under this subsection and the defendant is financially unable to make the restitution, the court may order the defendant to perform a specific number of hours of community service to satisfy the restitution.\n(4)  Notwithstanding Subsection (g)(4), a court shall direct a defendant ordered to make restitution under this subsection as a condition of community supervision to deliver the amount or property due as restitution to the defendant's supervising officer for transfer to the owner.  A parole panel shall direct a defendant ordered to make restitution under this subsection as a condition of parole or mandatory supervision to deliver the amount or property due as restitution to the defendant's supervising officer.  The defendant's supervising officer shall notify the court when the defendant has delivered the full amount of restitution ordered.\n(5)  For purposes of this subsection, \"official traffic-control device\" has the meaning assigned by Section 541.304, Transportation Code.\n(t)  If a person is convicted of an offense under Section 641.054, Business and Commerce Code, the court shall order the person to make restitution to an owner or lawful producer of a master recording that has suffered financial loss as a result of the offense or to a trade association that represents that owner or lawful producer.  The amount of restitution ordered shall be:\n(1)  the greater of:\n(A)  the aggregate wholesale value of the lawfully manufactured and authorized recordings corresponding to the number of nonconforming recordings involved in the offense; or\n(B)  the actual financial loss to the owner, lawful producer, or trade association; and\n(2)  the costs associated with investigating the offense.\n(u)  For purposes of Subsection (t)(1)(A):\n(1)  the calculation of the aggregate wholesale value is based on the average wholesale value of the lawfully manufactured and authorized recordings; and\n(2)  the specific wholesale value of each nonconforming recording is not relevant to the calculation.\n(v)  For purposes of Subsection (t)(1)(B), the possession of a nonconforming recording intended for sale constitutes an actual financial loss to an owner or lawful producer equal to the actual value of the legitimate wholesale purchases displaced by the nonconforming recordings.\n(w)  If a defendant is convicted of an offense under Section 42.0601, Penal Code, the court may order the defendant to make restitution to an entity for the reasonable costs of the emergency response by that entity resulting from the false report.\n(x)  A county shall accept a restitution payment received from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice under Section 493.035, Government Code, and forward the payment to the victim or other person eligible for restitution under this article, including the compensation to victims of crime fund.

    "content": "(a)  A plea of \"guilty\" or a plea of \"nolo contendere\" in a misdemeanor case may be made either by the defendant or his counsel in open court;  in such case, the defendant or his counsel may waive a jury, and the punishment may be assessed by the court either upon or without evidence, at the discretion of the court.\n(b)  A defendant charged with a misdemeanor for which the maximum possible punishment is by fine only may, in lieu of the method provided in Subsection (a), mail or deliver in person to the court a plea of \"guilty\" or a plea of \"nolo contendere\" and a waiver of jury trial. The defendant may also request in writing that the court notify the defendant, at the address stated in the request, of the amount of an appeal bond that the court will approve. If the court receives a plea and waiver before the time the defendant is scheduled to appear in court, the court shall dispose of the case without requiring a court appearance by the defendant. If the court receives a plea and waiver after the time the defendant is scheduled to appear in court but at least five business days before a scheduled trial date, the court shall dispose of the case without requiring a court appearance by the defendant. The court shall notify the defendant either in person or by regular mail of the amount of any fine or costs assessed in the case, information regarding the alternatives to the full payment of any fine or costs assessed against the defendant, if the defendant is unable to pay that amount, and, if requested by the defendant, the amount of an appeal bond that the court will approve. Except as otherwise provided by this code, the defendant shall pay any fine or costs assessed or give an appeal bond in the amount stated in the notice before the 31st day after receiving the notice. This subsection does not apply to a defendant charged with a misdemeanor involving family violence, as defined by Section 71.004, Family Code.\n(c) In a misdemeanor case for which the maximum possible punishment is by fine only, payment of a fine or an amount accepted by the court constitutes a finding of guilty in open court as though a plea of nolo contendere had been entered by the defendant and constitutes a waiver of a jury trial in writing.\nText of subsection effective until January 01, 2025\n(d)  If written notice of an offense for which maximum possible punishment is by fine only or of a violation relating to the manner, time, and place of parking has been prepared, delivered, and filed with the court and a legible duplicate copy has been given to the defendant, the written notice serves as a complaint to which the defendant may plead \"guilty,\" \"not guilty,\" or \"nolo contendere.\"  If the defendant pleads \"not guilty\" to the offense or fails to appear based on the written notice, a complaint shall be filed that conforms to the requirements of Chapter 45 of this code, and that complaint serves as an original complaint.  A defendant may waive the filing of a sworn complaint and elect that the prosecution proceed on the written notice of the charged offense if the defendant agrees in writing with the prosecution, signs the agreement, and files it with the court.\nText of subsection effective on January 01, 2025\n(d)  If written notice of an offense for which maximum possible punishment is by fine only or of a violation relating to the manner, time, and place of parking has been prepared, delivered, and filed with the court and a legible duplicate copy has been given to the defendant, the written notice serves as a complaint to which the defendant may plead \"guilty,\" \"not guilty,\" or \"nolo contendere.\"  If the defendant pleads \"not guilty\" to the offense or fails to appear based on the written notice, a complaint shall be filed that conforms to the requirements of Chapter 45A, and that complaint serves as an original complaint.  A defendant may waive the filing of a sworn complaint and elect that the prosecution proceed on the written notice of the charged offense if the defendant agrees in writing with the prosecution, signs the agreement, and files it with the court.\n(e)(1)  Before accepting a plea of guilty or a plea of nolo contendere by a defendant charged with a misdemeanor involving family violence, as defined by Section 71.004, Family Code, the court shall admonish the defendant by using the following statement:\n\"If you are convicted of a misdemeanor offense involving violence where you are or were a spouse, intimate partner, parent, or guardian of the victim or are or were involved in another, similar relationship with the victim, it may be unlawful for you to possess or purchase a firearm, including a handgun or long gun, or ammunition, pursuant to federal law under 18 U.S.C. Section 922(g)(9) or Section 46.04(b), Texas Penal Code.

Not later than the 30th day after the final conviction of a person for an offense involving a prohibited weapon, the court entering the judgment of conviction on its own motion, on the motion of the prosecuting attorney in the case, or on the motion of the law enforcement agency initiating the complaint on notice to the prosecuting attorney in the case if the prosecutor fails to move for the order shall order that the prohibited weapon be destroyed or forfeited to the law enforcement agency that initiated the complaint.  If the court fails to enter the order within the time required by this subsection, any magistrate in the county in which the offense occurred may enter the order.  Following the final conviction of a person for an offense involving dog fighting, the court entering the judgment of conviction shall order that any dog-fighting equipment be destroyed or forfeited to the state.  Destruction of dogs, if necessary, must be carried out by a veterinarian licensed in this state or, if one is not available, by trained personnel of a humane society or an animal shelter.

If gambling proceeds were seized, the court shall order them forfeited to the state and shall transmit them to the grand jury of the county in which they were seized for use in investigating alleged violations of the Penal Code, or to the state, any political subdivision of the state, or to any state institution or agency.\n(b)  If there is no prosecution or conviction following seizure, the magistrate to whom the return was made shall notify in writing the person found in possession of the alleged gambling device or equipment, altered gambling equipment or gambling paraphernalia, gambling proceeds, prohibited weapon, obscene device or material, child pornography, scanning device or re-encoder, criminal instrument, or dog-fighting equipment to show cause why the property seized should not be destroyed or the proceeds forfeited.  The magistrate, on the motion of the law enforcement agency seizing a prohibited weapon, shall order the weapon destroyed or forfeited to the law enforcement agency seizing the weapon, unless a person shows cause as to why the prohibited weapon should not be destroyed or forfeited.  A law enforcement agency shall make a motion under this section in a timely manner after the time at which the agency is informed in writing by the attorney representing the state that no prosecution will arise from the seizure.\n(c) The magistrate shall include in the notice a detailed description of the property seized and the total amount of alleged gambling proceeds;  the name of the person found in possession;  the address where the property or proceeds were seized;  and the date and time of the seizure.\n(d) The magistrate shall send the notice by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the person found in possession at the address where the property or proceeds were seized.

Failure to timely appear forfeits any interest the person may have in the property or proceeds seized, and no person after failing to timely appear may contest destruction or forfeiture.\n(f)  If a person timely appears to show cause why the property or proceeds should not be destroyed or forfeited, the magistrate shall conduct a hearing on the issue and determine the nature of property or proceeds and the person's interest therein.  Unless the person proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the property or proceeds is not gambling equipment, altered gambling equipment, gambling paraphernalia, gambling device, gambling proceeds, prohibited weapon, obscene device or material, child pornography, criminal instrument, scanning device or re-encoder, or dog-fighting equipment and that he is entitled to possession, the magistrate shall dispose of the property or proceeds in accordance with Paragraph (a) of this article.\n(g)  For purposes of this article:\n(1)  \"criminal instrument\" has the meaning defined in the Penal Code;\n(2)  \"gambling device or equipment, altered gambling equipment or gambling paraphernalia\" has the meaning defined in the Penal Code;\n(3)  \"prohibited weapon\" has the meaning defined in the Penal Code;\n(4)  \"dog-fighting equipment\" means:\n(A)  equipment used for training or handling a fighting dog, including a harness, treadmill, cage, decoy, pen, house for keeping a fighting dog, feeding apparatus, or training pen;\n(B)  equipment used for transporting a fighting dog, including any automobile, or other vehicle, and its appurtenances which are intended to be used as a vehicle for transporting a fighting dog;\n(C)  equipment used to promote or advertise an exhibition of dog fighting, including a printing press or similar equipment, paper, ink, or photography equipment; or\n(D)  a dog trained, being trained, or intended to be used to fight with another dog;\n(5)  \"obscene device\" and \"obscene\" have the meanings assigned by Section 43.21, Penal Code;\n(6)  \"re-encoder\" has the meaning assigned by Section 522.001, Business & Commerce Code;\n(7)  \"scanning device\" has the meaning assigned by Section 522.001, Business & Commerce Code; and\n(8)  \"obscene material\" and \"child pornography\" include digital images and the media and equipment on which those images are stored.\n(h)  No provider of an electronic communication service or of a remote computing service to the public shall be held liable for an offense involving obscene material or child pornography under this section on account of any action taken in good faith in providing that service.\nActs 1965, 59th Leg., vol. 2, p. 317, ch. 722.

    "content": "1.  Withdrawal\na.  Once effective, the Compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every Compacting State; provided, that a Compacting State may withdraw from the Compact (\"Withdrawing State\") by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the Compact into law.\nb.  The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repealing statute. However, the withdrawal shall not apply to any product filings approved or self-certified, or any Advertisement of such products, on the date the repealing statute becomes effective, except by mutual agreement of the Commission and the Withdrawing State unless the approval is rescinded by the Withdrawing State as provided in Paragraph e of this section.\nc.  The Commissioner of the Withdrawing State shall immediately notify the Management Committee in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this Compact in the Withdrawing State.\nd.  The Commission shall notify the other Compacting States of the introduction of such legislation within ten (10) days after its receipt of notice thereof.\ne.  The Withdrawing State is responsible for all obligations, duties and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal, except to the extent those obligations may have been released or relinquished by mutual agreement of the Commission and the Withdrawing State.  The Commission's approval of Products and Advertisement prior to the effective date of withdrawal shall continue to be effective and be given full force and effect in the Withdrawing State, unless formally rescinded by the Withdrawing State in the same manner as provided by the laws of the Withdrawing State for the prospective disapproval of products or advertisement previously approved under state law.\nf.  Reinstatement following withdrawal of any Compacting State shall occur upon the effective date of the Withdrawing State reenacting the Compact.\n2.  Default\na.  If the Commission determines that any Compacting State has at any time defaulted (\"Defaulting State\") in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact, the Bylaws or duly promulgated Rules or Operating Procedures, then, after notice and hearing as set forth in the Bylaws, all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact on the Defaulting State shall be suspended from the effective date of default as fixed by the Commission.  The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a Compacting State to perform its obligations or responsibilities, and any other grounds designated in Commission Rules.  The Commission shall immediately notify the Defaulting State in writing of the Defaulting State's suspension pending a cure of the default.  The Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the Defaulting State must cure its default.  If the Defaulting State fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Commission, the Defaulting State shall be terminated from the Compact and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.\nb.  Product approvals by the Commission or product self-certifications, or any Advertisement in connection with such product, that are in force on the effective date of termination shall remain in force in the Defaulting State in the same manner as if the Defaulting State had withdrawn voluntarily pursuant to Section 1 of this article.\nc.  Reinstatement following termination of any Compacting State requires a reenactment of the Compact.\n3.  Dissolution of Compact\na.  The Compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the Compacting State which reduces membership in the Compact to one Compacting State.\nb.  Upon the dissolution of this Compact, the Compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the Bylaws."

The Interstate Commission shall be a body corporate and joint agency of the compacting states.  The commission shall have all the responsibilities, powers, and duties set forth herein, and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action of the respective legislatures of the compacting states in accordance with the terms of this compact.\nB.  The Interstate Commission shall consist of commissioners appointed by the appropriate appointing authority in each state pursuant to the rules and requirements of each compacting state.  The commissioner shall be the compact administrator, deputy compact administrator, or designee from that state who shall serve on the Interstate Commission in such capacity under or pursuant to the applicable law of the compacting state.\nC.

Such noncommissioner members must include a member of the national organizations of governors, legislators, state chief justices, attorneys general, Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, juvenile justice and juvenile corrections officials, and crime victims.  All noncommissioner members of the Interstate Commission shall be ex officio (nonvoting) members.

A majority of the compacting states shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, unless a larger quorum is required by the bylaws of the Interstate Commission.\nE.

The executive committee shall oversee the day-to-day activities of the administration of the compact managed by an executive director and Interstate Commission staff; administers enforcement and compliance with the provisions of the compact, its bylaws and rules, and performs such other duties as directed by the Interstate Commission or set forth in the bylaws.\nG.  Each member of the Interstate Commission shall have the right and power to cast a vote to which that compacting state is entitled and to participate in the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission.  A member shall vote in person and shall not delegate a vote to another compacting state. However, a commissioner shall appoint another authorized representative, in the absence of the commissioner from that state, to cast a vote on behalf of the compacting state at a specified meeting.  The bylaws may provide for members' participation in meetings by telephone or other means of telecommunication or electronic communication.\nH.  The Interstate Commission's bylaws shall establish conditions and procedures under which the Interstate Commission shall make its information and official records available to the public for inspection or copying.  The Interstate Commission may exempt from disclosure any information or official records to the extent they would adversely affect personal privacy rights or proprietary interests.\nI.  Public notice shall be given of all meetings and all meetings shall be open to the public, except as set forth in the rules or as otherwise provided in the compact.  The Interstate Commission and any of its committees may close a meeting to the public when it determines by two-thirds vote that an open meeting would be likely to:\n1.

Specifically relate to the Interstate Commission's issuance of a subpoena, or its participation in a civil action or other legal proceeding.\nJ.  For every meeting closed pursuant to this provision, the Interstate Commission's legal counsel shall publicly certify that, in the legal counsel's opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public, and shall reference each relevant exemptive provision.  The Interstate Commission shall keep minutes which shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in any meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons therefore, including a description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of any roll call vote (reflected in the vote of each member on the question).  All documents considered in connection with any action shall be identified in such minutes.\nK.  The Interstate Commission shall collect standardized data concerning the interstate movement of juveniles as directed through its rules which shall specify the data to be collected, the means of collection and data exchange, and reporting requirements.

    "title": "2023 Texas Statutes Code of Criminal Procedure Title 1 - Code of Criminal Procedure Chapter 1 - General Provisions Article 1.051. Right to Representation by Counsel",
    "content": "(a)  A defendant in a criminal matter is entitled to be represented by counsel in an adversarial judicial proceeding.  The right to be represented by counsel includes the right to consult in private with counsel sufficiently in advance of a proceeding to allow adequate preparation for the proceeding.\n(b) For the purposes of this article and Articles 26.04 and 26.05 of this code, \"indigent\" means a person who is not financially able to employ counsel.\n(c)  An indigent defendant is entitled to have an attorney appointed to represent him in any adversary judicial proceeding that may result in punishment by confinement and in any other criminal proceeding if the court concludes that the interests of justice require representation.  Subject to Subsection (c-1), if an indigent defendant is entitled to and requests appointed counsel and if adversarial judicial proceedings have been initiated against the defendant, a court or the courts' designee authorized under Article 26.04 to appoint counsel for indigent defendants in the county in which the defendant is arrested shall appoint counsel as soon as possible, but not later than:\n(1)  the end of the third working day after the date on which the court or the courts' designee receives the defendant's request for appointment of counsel, if the defendant is arrested in a county with a population of less than 250,000; or\n(2)  the end of the first working day after the date on which the court or the courts' designee receives the defendant's request for appointment of counsel, if the defendant is arrested in a county with a population of 250,000 or more.\n(c-1)  If an indigent defendant is arrested under a warrant issued in a county other than the county in which the arrest was made and the defendant is entitled to and requests appointed counsel, a court or the courts' designee authorized under Article 26.04 to appoint counsel for indigent defendants in the county that issued the warrant shall appoint counsel within the periods prescribed by Subsection (c), regardless of whether the defendant is present within the county issuing the warrant and even if adversarial judicial proceedings have not yet been initiated against the defendant in the county issuing the warrant.  However, if the defendant has not been transferred or released into the custody of the county issuing the warrant before the 11th day after the date of the arrest and if counsel has not otherwise been appointed for the defendant in the arresting county under this article, a court or the courts' designee authorized under Article 26.04 to appoint counsel for indigent defendants in the arresting county immediately shall appoint counsel to represent the defendant in any matter under Chapter 11 or 17, regardless of whether adversarial judicial proceedings have been initiated against the defendant in the arresting county.  If counsel is appointed for the defendant in the arresting county as required by this subsection, the arresting county may seek from the county that issued the warrant reimbursement for the actual costs paid by the arresting county for the appointed counsel.\n(d) An eligible indigent defendant is entitled to have the trial court appoint an attorney to represent him in the following appellate and postconviction habeas corpus matters:\n(1) an appeal to a court of appeals;\n(2) an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeals if the appeal is made directly from the trial court or if a petition for discretionary review has been granted;\n(3) a habeas corpus proceeding if the court concludes that the interests of justice require representation;  and\n(4) any other appellate proceeding if the court concludes that the interests of justice require representation.\n(e)  An appointed counsel is entitled to 10 days to prepare for a proceeding but may waive the preparation time with the consent of the defendant in writing or on the record in open court.  If a nonindigent defendant appears without counsel at a proceeding after having been given a reasonable opportunity to retain counsel, the court, on 10 days' notice to the defendant of a dispositive setting, may proceed with the matter without securing a written waiver or appointing counsel. If an indigent defendant who has refused appointed counsel in order to retain private counsel appears without counsel after having been given an opportunity to retain counsel, the court, after giving the defendant a reasonable opportunity to request appointment of counsel or, if the defendant elects not to request appointment of counsel, after obtaining a waiver of the right to counsel pursuant to Subsections (f) and (g), may proceed with the matter on 10 days' notice to the defendant of a dispositive setting.\n(f)  A defendant may voluntarily and intelligently waive in writing the right to counsel.  A waiver obtained in violation of Subsection (f-1) or (f-2) is presumed invalid.\n(f-1)  In any adversary judicial proceeding that may result in punishment by confinement, the attorney representing the state may not:\n(1)  initiate or encourage an attempt to obtain from a defendant who is not represented by counsel a waiver of the right to counsel; or\n(2)  communicate with a defendant who has requested the appointment of counsel, unless the court or the court's designee authorized under Article 26.04 to appoint counsel for indigent defendants in the county has denied the request and, subsequent to the denial, the defendant:\n(A)  has been given a reasonable opportunity to retain and has failed to retain private counsel; or\n(B)  waives or has waived the opportunity to retain private counsel.\n(f-2)  In any adversary judicial proceeding that may result in punishment by confinement, the court may not direct or encourage the defendant to communicate with the attorney representing the state until the court advises the defendant of the right to counsel and the procedure for requesting appointed counsel and the defendant has been given a reasonable opportunity to request appointed counsel.  If the defendant has requested appointed counsel, the court may not direct or encourage the defendant to communicate with the attorney representing the state unless the court or the court's designee authorized under Article 26.04 to appoint counsel for indigent defendants in the county has denied the request and, subsequent to the denial, the defendant:\n(1)  has been given a reasonable opportunity to retain and has failed to retain private counsel; or\n(2)  waives or has waived the opportunity to retain private counsel.\n(g)  If a defendant wishes to waive the right to counsel for purposes of entering a guilty plea or proceeding to trial, the court shall advise the defendant of the nature of the charges against the defendant and, if the defendant is proceeding to trial, the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation.  If the court determines that the waiver is voluntarily and intelligently made, the court shall provide the defendant with a statement substantially in the following form, which, if signed by the defendant, shall be filed with and become part of the record of the proceedings:\n\"I have been advised this ______ day of __________, 2 ____, by the (name of court) Court of my right to representation by counsel in the case pending against me.  I have been further advised that if I am unable to afford counsel, one will be appointed for me free of charge.  Understanding my right to have counsel appointed for me free of charge if I am not financially able to employ counsel, I wish to waive that right and request the court to proceed with my case without an attorney being appointed for me.  I hereby waive my right to counsel.  (signature of defendant)\"\n(h) A defendant may withdraw a waiver of the right to counsel at any time but is not entitled to repeat a proceeding previously held or waived solely on the grounds of the subsequent appointment or retention of counsel.  If the defendant withdraws a waiver, the trial court, in its discretion, may provide the appointed counsel 10 days to prepare.\n(i)  Subject to Subsection (c-1), with respect to a county with a population of less than 250,000, if an indigent defendant is entitled to and requests appointed counsel and if adversarial judicial proceedings have not been initiated against the defendant, a court or the courts' designee authorized under Article 26.04 to appoint counsel for indigent defendants in the county in which the defendant is arrested shall appoint counsel immediately following the expiration of three working days after the date on which the court or the courts' designee receives the defendant's request for appointment of counsel.  If adversarial judicial proceedings are initiated against the defendant before the expiration of the three working days, the court or the courts' designee shall appoint counsel as provided by Subsection (c).  Subject to Subsection (c-1), in a county with a population of 250,000 or more, the court or the courts' designee shall appoint counsel as required by this subsection immediately following the expiration of one working day after the date on which the court or the courts' designee receives the defendant's request for appointment of counsel.  If adversarial judicial proceedings are initiated against the defendant before the expiration of the one working day, the court or the courts' designee shall appoint counsel as provided by Subsection (c).\n(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if an indigent defendant is released from custody prior to the appointment of counsel under this section, appointment of counsel is not required until the defendant's first court appearance or when adversarial judicial proceedings are initiated, whichever comes first.\n(k)  A court or the courts' designee may without unnecessary delay appoint new counsel to represent an indigent defendant for whom counsel is appointed under Subsection (c), (c-1), or (i) if:\n(1)  the defendant is subsequently charged in the case with an offense different from the offense with which the defendant was initially charged; and\n(2)  good cause to appoint new counsel is stated on the record as required by Article 26.04(j)(2).\nAdded by Acts 1987, 70th Leg., ch. 979, Sec. 1, eff.

A sworn affidavit setting forth substantial facts establishing probable cause shall be filed in every instance in which a search warrant is requested.  Except as otherwise provided by this code, the affidavit becomes public information when the search warrant for which the affidavit was presented is executed, and the magistrate's clerk shall make a copy of the affidavit available for public inspection in the clerk's office during normal business hours.\n(b-1)(1)  For purposes of this article, a magistrate may consider information communicated by telephone or other reliable electronic means in determining whether to issue a search warrant.

    "title": "2023 Texas Statutes Code of Criminal Procedure Title 1 - Code of Criminal Procedure Chapter 26 - Arraignment Article 26.04. Procedures for Appointing Counsel",
    "content": "(a)  The judges of the county courts, statutory county courts, and district courts trying criminal cases in each county, by local rule, shall adopt and publish written countywide procedures for timely and fairly appointing counsel for an indigent defendant in the county arrested for, charged with, or taking an appeal from a conviction of a misdemeanor punishable by confinement or a felony.  The procedures must be consistent with this article and Articles 1.051, 15.17, 15.18, 26.05, and 26.052 and must provide for the priority appointment of a public defender's office as described by Subsection (f).  A court shall appoint an attorney from a public appointment list using a system of rotation, unless the court appoints an attorney under Subsection (f), (f-1), (h), or (i).  The court shall appoint attorneys from among the next five names on the appointment list in the order in which the attorneys' names appear on the list, unless the court makes a finding of good cause on the record for appointing an attorney out of order.  An attorney who is not appointed in the order in which the attorney's name appears on the list shall remain next in order on the list.\n(b)  Procedures adopted under Subsection (a) shall:\n(1)  authorize only the judges of the county courts, statutory county courts, and district courts trying criminal cases in the county, or the judges' designee, to appoint counsel for indigent defendants in the county;\n(2)  apply to each appointment of counsel made by a judge or the judges' designee in the county;\n(3)  ensure that each indigent defendant in the county who is charged with a misdemeanor punishable by confinement or with a felony and who appears in court without counsel has an opportunity to confer with appointed counsel before the commencement of judicial proceedings;\n(4)  require appointments for defendants in capital cases in which the death penalty is sought to comply with any applicable requirements under Articles 11.071 and 26.052;\n(5)  ensure that each attorney appointed from a public appointment list to represent an indigent defendant perform the attorney's duty owed to the defendant in accordance with the adopted procedures, the requirements of this code, and applicable rules of ethics; and\n(6)  ensure that appointments are allocated among qualified attorneys in a manner that is fair, neutral, and nondiscriminatory.\n(c)  Whenever a court or the courts' designee authorized under Subsection (b) to appoint counsel for indigent defendants in the county determines for purposes of a criminal proceeding that a defendant charged with or appealing a conviction of a felony or a misdemeanor punishable by confinement is indigent or that the interests of justice require representation of a defendant in the proceeding, the court or the courts' designee shall appoint one or more practicing attorneys to represent the defendant in accordance with this subsection and the procedures adopted under Subsection (a).  If the court or the courts' designee determines that the defendant does not speak and understand the English language or that the defendant is deaf, the court or the courts' designee shall make an effort to appoint an attorney who is capable of communicating in a language understood by the defendant.\n(d)  A public appointment list from which an attorney is appointed as required by Subsection (a) shall contain the names of qualified attorneys, each of whom:\n(1)  applies to be included on the list;\n(2)  meets the objective qualifications specified by the judges under Subsection (e);\n(3)  meets any applicable qualifications specified by the Texas Indigent Defense Commission; and\n(4)  is approved by a majority of the judges who established the appointment list under Subsection (e).\n(e)  In a county in which a court is required under Subsection (a) to appoint an attorney from a public appointment list:\n(1)  the judges of the county courts and statutory county courts trying misdemeanor cases in the county, by formal action:\n(A)  shall:\n(i)  establish a public appointment list of attorneys qualified to provide representation in the county in misdemeanor cases punishable by confinement; and\n(ii)  specify the objective qualifications necessary for an attorney to be included on the list; and\n(B)  may establish, if determined by the judges to be appropriate, more than one appointment list graduated according to the degree of seriousness of the offense, the attorneys' qualifications, and whether representation will be provided in trial court proceedings, appellate proceedings, or both; and\n(2)  the judges of the district courts trying felony cases in the county, by formal action:\n(A)  shall:\n(i)  establish a public appointment list of attorneys qualified to provide representation in felony cases in the county; and\n(ii)  specify the objective qualifications necessary for an attorney to be included on the list; and\n(B)  may establish, if determined by the judges to be appropriate, more than one appointment list graduated according to the degree of seriousness of the offense, the attorneys' qualifications, and whether representation will be provided in trial court proceedings, appellate proceedings, or both.\n(f)  In a county with a public defender's office, the court or the courts' designee shall give priority in appointing that office to represent the defendant in the criminal proceeding, including a proceeding in a capital murder case.  However, the court is not required to appoint the public defender's office if:\n(1)  the court makes a finding of good cause for appointing other counsel, provided that in a capital murder case, the court makes a finding of good cause on the record for appointing that counsel;\n(2)  the appointment would be contrary to the office's written plan under Article 26.044;\n(3)  the office is prohibited from accepting the appointment under Article 26.044(j); or\n(4)  a managed assigned counsel program also exists in the county and an attorney will be appointed under that program.\n(f-1)  In a county in which a managed assigned counsel program is operated in accordance with Article 26.047, the managed assigned counsel program may appoint counsel to represent the defendant in accordance with the guidelines established for the program.\n(g)  A countywide alternative program for appointing counsel for indigent defendants in criminal cases is established by a formal action in which two-thirds of the judges of the courts designated under this subsection vote to establish the alternative program.  An alternative program for appointing counsel in misdemeanor and felony cases may be established in the manner provided by this subsection by the judges of the county courts, statutory county courts, and district courts trying criminal cases in the county.  An alternative program for appointing counsel in misdemeanor cases may be established in the manner provided by this subsection by the judges of the county courts and statutory county courts trying criminal cases in the county.  An alternative program for appointing counsel in felony cases may be established in the manner provided by this subsection by the judges of the district courts trying criminal cases in the county.  In a county in which an alternative program is established:\n(1)  the alternative program may:\n(A)  use a single method for appointing counsel or a combination of methods; and\n(B)  use a multicounty appointment list using a system of rotation; and\n(2)  the procedures adopted under Subsection (a) must ensure that:\n(A)  attorneys appointed using the alternative program to represent defendants in misdemeanor cases punishable by confinement:\n(i)  meet specified objective qualifications for that representation, which may be graduated according to the degree of seriousness of the offense and whether representation will be provided in trial court proceedings, appellate proceedings, or both; and\n(ii)  are approved by a majority of the judges of the county courts and statutory county courts trying misdemeanor cases in the county;\n(B)  attorneys appointed using the alternative program to represent defendants in felony cases:\n(i)  meet specified objective qualifications for that representation, which may be graduated according to the degree of seriousness of the offense and whether representation will be provided in trial court proceedings, appellate proceedings, or both; and\n(ii)  are approved by a majority of the judges of the district courts trying felony cases in the county;\n(C)  appointments for defendants in capital cases in which the death penalty is sought comply with the requirements of Article 26.052; and\n(D)  appointments are reasonably and impartially allocated among qualified attorneys.\n(h)  Subject to Subsection (f), in a county in which an alternative program for appointing counsel is established as provided by Subsection (g) and is approved by the presiding judge of the administrative judicial region, a court or the courts' designee may appoint an attorney to represent an indigent defendant by using the alternative program.  In establishing an alternative program under Subsection (g), the judges of the courts establishing the program may not, without the approval of the commissioners court, obligate the county by contract or by the creation of new positions that cause an increase in expenditure of county funds.\n(i)  Subject to Subsection (f), a court or the courts' designee required under Subsection (c) to appoint an attorney to represent a defendant accused or convicted of a felony may appoint an attorney from any county located in the court's administrative judicial region.\n(j)  An attorney appointed under this article shall:\n(1)  make every reasonable effort to contact the defendant not later than the end of the first working day after the date on which the attorney is appointed and to interview the defendant as soon as practicable after the attorney is appointed;\n(2)  represent the defendant until charges are dismissed, the defendant is acquitted, appeals are exhausted, or the attorney is permitted or ordered by the court to withdraw as counsel for the defendant after a finding of good cause is entered on the record;\n(3)  with respect to a defendant not represented by other counsel, before withdrawing as counsel for the defendant after a trial or the entry of a plea of guilty:\n(A)  advise the defendant of the defendant's right to file a motion for new trial and a notice of appeal;\n(B)  if the defendant wishes to pursue either or both remedies described by Paragraph (A), assist the defendant in requesting the prompt appointment of replacement counsel; and\n(C)  if replacement counsel is not appointed promptly and the defendant wishes to pursue an appeal, file a timely notice of appeal; and\n(4)  not later than October 15 of each year and on a form prescribed by the Texas Indigent Defense Commission, submit to the county information, for the preceding fiscal year, that describes the percentage of the attorney's practice time that was dedicated to work based on appointments accepted in the county under this article and Title 3, Family Code.\n(k)  A court may replace an attorney who violates Subsection (j)(1) with other counsel.  A majority of the judges of the county courts and statutory county courts or the district courts, as appropriate, trying criminal cases in the county may remove from consideration for appointment an attorney who intentionally or repeatedly violates Subsection (j)(1).\n(l)  Procedures adopted under Subsection (a) must include procedures and financial standards for determining whether a defendant is indigent.  The procedures and standards shall apply to each defendant in the county equally, regardless of whether the defendant is in custody or has been released on bail.\n(m)  In determining whether a defendant is indigent, the court or the courts' designee may consider the defendant's income, source of income, assets, property owned, outstanding obligations, necessary expenses, the number and ages of dependents, and spousal income that is available to the defendant. The court or the courts' designee may not consider whether the defendant has posted or is capable of posting bail, except to the extent that it reflects the defendant's financial circumstances as measured by the considerations listed in this subsection.\n(n)  A defendant who requests a determination of indigency and appointment of counsel shall:\n(1)  complete under oath a questionnaire concerning his financial resources;\n(2)  respond under oath to an examination regarding his financial resources by the judge or magistrate responsible for determining whether the defendant is indigent; or\n(3)  complete the questionnaire and respond to examination by the judge or magistrate.\n(o)  Before making a determination of whether a defendant is indigent, the court shall request the defendant to sign under oath a statement substantially in the following form:\n\"On this ________ day of ____________, 20 ___, I have been advised by the (name of the court) Court of my right to representation by counsel in connection with the charge pending against me.  I am without means to employ counsel of my own choosing and I hereby request the court to appoint counsel for me.  (signature of the defendant)\"\n(p)  A defendant who is determined by the court to be indigent is presumed to remain indigent for the remainder of the proceedings in the case unless a material change in the defendant's financial circumstances occurs. If there is a material change in financial circumstances after a determination of indigency or nonindigency is made, the defendant, the defendant's counsel, or the attorney representing the state may move for reconsideration of the determination.\n(q)  A written or oral statement elicited under this article or evidence derived from the statement may not be used for any purpose, except to determine the defendant's indigency or to impeach the direct testimony of the defendant.  This subsection does not prohibit prosecution of the defendant under Chapter 37, Penal Code.\n(r)  A court may not threaten to arrest or incarcerate a person solely because the person requests the assistance of counsel.\nActs 1965, 59th Leg., p. 317, ch. 722, Sec. 1, eff.

If the county has no purchasing agent, then such property shall be disposed of by the sheriff of the county.\n(b)  The county purchasing agent, the person designated by the municipality, or the sheriff of the county, as the case may be, shall mail a notice to the last known address of the owner of such property by certified mail.  Such notice shall describe the property being held, give the name and address of the officer holding such property, and shall state that if the owner does not claim such property within 90 days from the date of the notice such property will be disposed of and the proceeds, after deducting the reasonable expense of keeping such property and the costs of the disposition, placed in the treasury of the municipality or county giving the notice.\n(c)  If the property has a fair market value of $500 or more and the owner or the address of the owner is unknown, the person designated by the municipality, the county purchasing agent, or the sheriff, as the case may be, shall cause to be published once in a paper of general circulation in the municipality or county a notice containing a general description of the property held, the name of the owner if known, the name and address of the officer holding such property, and a statement that if the owner does not claim such property within 90 days from the date of the publication such property will be disposed of and the proceeds, after deducting the reasonable expense of keeping such property and the costs of the disposition, placed in the treasury of the municipality or county disposing of the property.  If the property has a fair market value of less than $500 and the owner or the address of the owner is unknown, the person designated by the municipality, the county purchasing agent, or the sheriff may sell or donate the property.  The person designated by the municipality, the purchasing agent, or the sheriff shall deposit the sale proceeds, after deducting the reasonable expense of keeping the property and costs of the sale, in the treasury of the municipality or county selling or donating the property.\n(d)  The sale under this article of any property that has a fair market value of $500 or more shall be preceded by a notice published once at least 14 days prior to the date of such sale in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality or county where the sale is to take place, stating the general description of the property, the names of the owner if known, and the date and place that such sale will occur.  This article does not require disposition by sale.\n(d-1)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d), if property described by Subsection (a), other than money, is seized by a peace officer at the time the owner of the property is arrested for an offense punishable as a Class C misdemeanor, the law enforcement agency may provide notice to the owner at the time the owner is taken into or released from custody.  On receiving the notice, the owner must sign the notice and attach a thumbprint to the notice.  The notice must include:\n(1)  a description of the property being held;\n(2)  the address where the property is being held; and\n(3)  a statement that if the owner does not claim the property before the 31st day after the date the owner is released from custody, the property will be disposed of and the proceeds of the property, after deducting the reasonable expense of keeping and disposing of the property, will be placed in the treasury of the municipality or county providing the notice.\n(d-2)  If the property for which notice is provided under Subsection (d-1) is not claimed by the owner before the 31st day after the date the owner is released from custody, the law enforcement agency holding the property shall deliver the property for disposition to a person designated by the municipality or to the purchasing agent or sheriff of the county in which the property was seized, as applicable.  The person designated by the municipality, the purchasing agent, or the sheriff may sell or donate the property without mailing or publishing an additional notice as required by Subsection (b), (c), or (d).  The sale proceeds, after deducting the reasonable expense of keeping and disposing of the property, must be deposited in the treasury of the municipality or county disposing of the property.\n(e)  The real owner of any property disposed of shall have the right to file a claim to the proceeds with the commissioners court of the county or with the governing body of the municipality in which the disposition took place.  A claim by the real owner must be filed not later than the 30th day after the date of disposition.  If the claim is allowed by the commissioners court or the governing body of the municipality, the municipal or county treasurer shall pay the owner such funds as were paid into the treasury of the municipality or county as proceeds of the disposition. If the claim is denied by the commissioners court or the governing body or if said court or body fails to act upon such claim within 90 days, the claimant may sue the municipal or county treasurer in a court of competent jurisdiction in the county, and upon sufficient proof of ownership, recover judgment against such municipality or county for the recovery of the proceeds of the disposition.\n(f)  For the purposes of this article:\n(1)  \"Person designated by a municipality\" means an officer or employee of a municipality who is designated by the municipality to be primarily responsible for the disposition of property under this article.\n(2)  \"Property held as evidence\" means property related to a charge that has been filed or to a matter that is being investigated for the filing of a charge.\n(g)  If the provisions of this section have been met and the property is scheduled for disposition, the municipal or county law enforcement agency that originally seized the property may request and have the property converted to agency use.  The agency at any time may transfer the property to another municipal or county law enforcement agency for the use of that agency.  The agency last using the property shall return the property to the person designated by the municipality, county purchasing agent, or sheriff, as the case may be, for disposition when the agency has completed the intended use of the property.\n(h)  If the abandoned or unclaimed personal property is money, the person designated by the municipality, the county purchasing agent, or the sheriff of the county, as appropriate, may, after giving notice under Subsection (b) or (c) of this article, deposit the money in the treasury of the municipality or county giving notice without conducting the sale as required by Subsection (d) of this article.\n(i)  While offering the property for sale under this article, if a person designated by a municipality, county purchasing agent, or sheriff considers any bid as insufficient, the person, agent, or sheriff may decline the bid and reoffer the property for sale.\n(j)  Chapters 72, 74, 75, and 76, Property Code, do not apply to unclaimed or abandoned property to which this article applies.\nActs 1965, 59th Leg., vol. 2, p. 317, ch. 722.

I am without means to pay ______ and I hereby request that an appropriate bail be set. (signature of defendant).\"\n(g)  A defendant filing an affidavit under Subsection (f) shall complete a form to allow a magistrate to assess information relevant to the defendant's financial situation.  The form must be the form used to request appointment of counsel under Article 26.04 or a form promulgated by the Office of Court Administration of the Texas Judicial System that collects, at a minimum and to the best of the defendant's knowledge, the information a court may consider under Article 26.04(m).\n(g-1)  The magistrate making the bail decision under Subsection (a) shall, if applicable:\n(1)  inform the defendant of the defendant's right to file an affidavit under Subsection (f); and\n(2)  ensure that the defendant receives reasonable assistance in completing the affidavit described by Subsection (f) and the form described by Subsection (g).\n(h)  A defendant described by Subsection (f) may file an affidavit under Subsection (f) at any time before or during the bail proceeding under Subsection (a).

The budget must be detailed and clearly list and define the categories of expenditures, but may not list details that would endanger the security of an investigation or prosecution.  Expenditures are subject to the audit and enforcement provisions established under this chapter.
